<p>The objective of this challenge is to utilize the visual analytics process to identify and categorize the products and services offered by companies based on their similarity. To achieve this, we will utilize <strong>Topic modeling</strong> <strong>(LDA)</strong>, to extract the main objectives from each group. Through this method, we can assign topics to business group based on their product_service description. Subsequently, we will proceed to cluster the companies together based on their similarities.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploring-revenue-distribution-across-diverse-sectors">Exploring Revenue Distribution Across Diverse Sectors</h3>
<p>Observation:</p>
<p>In our analysis of different industries, we examined the median revenue for each industry. The manufacturing and construction equipment industry stood out with the highest median revenue, reaching approximately 34,000 omu. This industry’s strong performance can be attributed to its focus on producing machinery, steel casting, and utilizing power for construction purposes.</p>
<p>Following closely behind is the freight and logistics industry, which boasts a median revenue of 33,000 omu. This industry is involved in the transportation and storage of goods, both by air and sea. Its pivotal role in facilitating trade and commerce contributes to its solid revenue figures.</p>
<p>Not far behind is the food packaging and grocery industry, with a median revenue of 32,000 omu. This sector specializes in packaging food products, ensuring their quality and preservation. It also includes the grocery segment, offering a wide range of food items to consumers.</p>
<p>In the fourth position is the textile and paper industry, with a median revenue of 28.6 thousand omu. This industry is involved in the production of textiles, paper products, and related materials. It plays a vital role in the manufacturing and supply chain of various consumer goods.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, we find the seafood industry with a median revenue of 27,000 omu. This industry focuses on the harvesting, processing, and distribution of seafood products, meeting the demand for fresh and high-quality seafood.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the fashion and apparel industry, which also showcases a median revenue of 27,000 omu. This sector encompasses the design, manufacturing, and retail of clothing and accessories, catering to fashion-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>These findings shed light on the revenue distribution across different industries. It’s clear that the manufacturing and construction equipment industry leads the way, followed closely by freight and logistics, and food packaging and grocery.</p>
